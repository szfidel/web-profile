      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wanted to do some changes to my website, but the thought of learning a JavaScript framework made me drag my feet a lot. As you know, I am not a web developer, but I love software and learning new things. Fortunately, I found Hugo, an open source framework for static websites and blogs written in Go. The best thing about it is that I can write my entries in Markdown and Hugo will make the HTML. One of the things that I really wanted to explore is blogging, and Hugo is fantastic for that. I can do it directly in my terminal and push it to my repository on GitHub. To make things easier, I am using GitHub Pages so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about anything else other than the content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;That being said, welcome to my new website and my first blog! I will write from time to time, hopefully regularly, about new projects or technologies. Since the blog is a passion project, I&amp;rsquo;d rather ship fast than make them perfect. Some of them may be half-cooked ideas, but the motivation is to share my interests and attract other people to share knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the last thing is that I want to keep the blogs short, more like microblogging. Thanks for reading, and feel free to connect with me, you&amp;rsquo;ll find my socials in the Contact menu. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
