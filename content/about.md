I'm a data analyst passionate about building robust solutions with open-source technologies and software development. My work centres around transforming complex data into actionable insights and developing efficient, scalable applications.

## What I Do

I specialise in data analytics and software development, with a particular focus on Python-based solutions and SQL-driven data processing. Whether it's building automated data pipelines, creating analytical dashboards, or developing custom applications, I believe in leveraging the right tools for each challenge.

My technical toolkit includes Python for data analysis and application development, SQL for database design and complex queries, and bash/zsh scripting for automation. I'm also proficient with Excel for rapid prototyping and stakeholder communication, and I use neovim and tmux for efficient development workflows.

## My Philosophy

I'm a strong advocate for open-source software and the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well. My preferred development environment runs on Debian Linux, where I appreciate the stability, security, and flexibility that comes with a well-maintained distribution. This foundation allows me to focus on what matters most: solving problems and delivering value.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog serves as both a technical journal and a resource for fellow developers and analysts. I share insights from my projects, explore new technologies, and document solutions to challenges I encounter. You'll find posts ranging from data analysis techniques and Python best practices to Linux system administration and development workflow optimisations.

Whether you're here to learn about a specific technical topic or to explore potential collaboration opportunities, I'm glad you stopped by. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss a project or simply connect with a fellow technology enthusiast.
