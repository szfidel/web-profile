# How did I end up here?

The year was 2016 when I met Richard Stallman, father of the Free Software movement
and GNU operating system. I'd heard about Linux before, but Richard definitely opened
my world to new possibilities. I tried a couple of Linux distributions: Fedora and
Mint. Overall, I liked Fedora more, but it was way easier to use Mint on a daily basis.
However, I didn't stick to it. I changed my MacBook at the time to a Windows laptop and just moved on.

In 2021, I went back to Mac, and that was when I started to see the shortcomings of operating systems.
For development, I like Mac, it's easy to navigate and use, but I think I'd rather use
Windows on a daily basis. That being said, I think Windows and macOS suck in their own way.
Windows feels like spyware more and more, and macOS is so opinionated in its UI
that it can be very frustrating, plus the new AI stuff in both is not great for me.

# Getting serious about Linux

To be honest, I can be a little bit of a rebel, and conforming with the norm is not
really my thing. My best friend sent me an article about a guy who tried daily driving Linux and never went back.
It really scratched that part of my brain that makes me obsess over things.
I started slow. I wanted Excel, but I have a Mac, and I freaking hate Numbers, but I needed something to work,
especially since we work with China and they can't use Google. The solution was LibreOffice.
Turns out you can personalise your software. What? Is this free as in freedom?

In my current job, I was tasked to create a new and shiny tech infrastructure,
moving from text messages and Google suite to an actual system for our processes of
sourcing, project management, and sales. The two winners: Slack and Odoo (open source ERP).

Odoo has a community edition that you can run on premise. I needed to test the product,
so I decided to run a virtual machine with Debian. Why Debian? I wanted something lean.
Odoo recommended Ubuntu, and I thought, well, Debian is like the father of Ubuntu, right?

Debian 12 was extremely easy to install. I went into the rabbit hole: what is a Desktop Environment?
Tiling window manager? Arch with Hyprland? I tried them all, even XFCE with i3 instead of its native window manager.
I can honestly say I've installed Debian 20 times by now. Running the Odoo service was way
more complicated than expected—connecting the PSQL to DBeaver, another day, haha.
Everything took ages, but honestly, it was amazing. I could do whatever I wanted.

I decided to buy a second-hand ThinkPad as my personal computer and use Debian as my main
OS. Turns out KDE is great, and now I daily drive Sway. I found The Primeagen, Josean, Typecraft, Linux Cast,
DistroTube, DHH, Diinki—an amazing community where we all think that our computer should be ours.

The increasing amount of time I spent in the terminal made me dive into CLI tools like tmux, Neovim, and Yazi.
I became keyboard-centric. Now I use Home Row and an ergonomic keyboard.
Honestly, I think Linux made me a better professional. I not only use software now,
I'm passionate about it. I'm not afraid of not knowing or of endless documentation.
The amount of frustration you get from failing to change something in your config is
rewarded with resilience and accomplishment. I love computers now. They're not only
tools I use, they say something about me.
